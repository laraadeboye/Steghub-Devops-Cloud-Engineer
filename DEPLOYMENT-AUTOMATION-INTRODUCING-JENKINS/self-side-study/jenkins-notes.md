# Jenkins Instance Sizing Recommendations

## Test Environment
For a test environment, a smaller instance size is generally sufficient.  
**Recommended**: `t3.medium`

- **2 vCPUs**
- **4 GB RAM**

This size should be adequate for most test environments, allowing for basic CI/CD pipelines without significant resource constraints.

## Production Environment
For a production environment, the instance size depends on various factors such as the number of concurrent builds, complexity of jobs, and number of plugins. However, a general recommendation would be:  
**Recommended**: `t3.large` or `m5.large`

- **2 vCPUs**
- **8 GB RAM**

For more resource-intensive setups:  
**Consider**: `t3.xlarge` or `m5.xlarge`

- **4 vCPUs**
- **16 GB RAM**

## Scaling Considerations
Jenkins documentation suggests the following rule of thumb for scaling:

- **1 GB RAM for Jenkins**
- **1 GB RAM for each concurrent build job**

## Note
These recommendations are starting points. Monitor your Jenkins instance performance and adjust as necessary based on your specific workload and requirements. Consider factors such as:

- Number and complexity of jobs
- Frequency of builds
- Number of plugins
- Integration with other tools

Always perform thorough testing to ensure the chosen instance type meets your performance needs.
