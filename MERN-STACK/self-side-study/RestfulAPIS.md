# RESTful APIS
RESTful APIs are a cornerstone of modern web development, enabling efficient communication between clients and servers through standardized protocols and principles. Their flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration make them ideal for building robust web applications that can evolve with changing requirements. 

## Key Principles of REST
- Uniform Interface: Simplifies the architecture by defining a standard way for clients and servers to communicate, typically using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

- Client-Server Architecture: Separates the user interface from data storage, allowing both to evolve independently.

- Statelessness: Each request from a client must contain all the information needed to process it; the server does not store any client context.

- Cacheability: Responses are labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve performance.

- Layered System: The architecture can be composed of hierarchical layers, enhancing scalability and manageability.

- Code on Demand (Optional): Clients can be extended by downloading executable code (e.g., JavaScript applets).
