## Understanding the LAMP Stack

The LAMP stack is a popular open-source web development platform that includes the following components:

- **Linux** - The operating system that runs the web server
- **Apache** - The web server software that delivers web content
- **MySQL** - The database management system for storing and managing data
- **PHP** - The programming language used to create dynamic web pages

Together, these components work seamlessly to create and run web applications. 

Below is a high-level overview of how the LAMP stack works:
A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server for a specific web page or resource.
Apache receives the request and processes any PHP code embedded in the web page. This could involve retrieving data from the MySQL database.
Apache sends the processed page back to the client's web browser, which then renders the HTML and displays the page to the user.
